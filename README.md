# Whatsapp-bot

A WhatsApp bot that can do things with commands!

> note: _bot is still in development and is a leisure project of mine_

# How to run

- To run, download the repo and in the terminal open the folder where you extracted the files and run `node .` or `npm start` in the terminal

* If your running it for first time, a qr code will be logged in the terminal
* Scan the qr code using the whatsapp account you intend to use for the bot from linked devices
* You wont need to scan the qr again after that, when bot is ready `Client is ready!` will be logged to console
